The Guv'nor, Spain;We asked some of our most prized winemakers working in Spain to make the best wines possible – no rules, no restrictions, no red tape. The Guv'nor collection was their answer. Made from Tempranillo grapes picked from their favourite vineyards across Spain, it’s a crowd-pleasing wine designed to be shared with good food – and even better company. It’s bold. It’s fruity. It’s a modern Spanish red that goes with everything, especially spicy barbecue meats or anything chargrilled.;£9.99 per bottle;75CL;Tempranillo;null;Natural Cork;Spain;Vanilla, Blackberry, Blackcurrant;Red;ABV 14.00%;null;Rich & Juicy;NV
Bread & Butter 'Winemaker's Selection' Chardonnay 2020/21, California;This really does what it says on the tin. It’s a lush Chardonnay which tastes of – you guessed it – bread and butter. The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It’s silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It’s incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.;£15.99 per bottle;75CL;Chardonnay;null;Natural Cork;USA;Vanilla, Almond, Coconut, Green Apple, Peach, Pineapple, Stone Fruit;White;ABV 13.50%;California;Rich & Toasty;2021
Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough;Oyster Bay has been an award-winning gold-standard Marlborough Sauvignon since its very first vintage, and it’s only got better and better. It was even formerly named the ‘Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World’ – and they have the name recognition to prove it. It’s really no surprise then that their Sauvignon is textbook Marlborough. Big. Fruity. Tropical. To say it’s mouth-wateringly refreshing is an understatement – the smell of gooseberries and lime will hit you the minute you unscrew the bottle. It’s really versatile – delicious as a glassful on sofa, for parties or with a flaky goat’s cheese tart. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.;£12.49 per bottle;75CL;Sauvignon Blanc;null;Screwcap;New Zealand;Tropical Fruit, Gooseberry, Grapefruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit;White;ABV 13.00%;Marlborough;Crisp & Zesty;2022
Louis Latour Mâcon-Lugny 2021/22;We’ve sold this wine for thirty years – and for that whole time it’s been a bestseller. Why’s it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It’s proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.;£17.99 per bottle;75CL;Chardonnay;null;Natural Cork;France;Peach, Apricot, Floral, Lemon;White;ABV 13.50%;Burgundy;Ripe & Rounded;2022
Bread & Butter 'Winemaker's Selection' Pinot Noir 2021, California;Bread & Butter is that thing that you can count on. It’s dependable, comforting – you know what to expect. That’s exactly what you’ll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It’s sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It’s exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It’s all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It’s seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes. Perfect with roast mushrooms.;£15.99 per bottle;75CL;Pinot Noir;null;Natural Cork;USA;Smoke, Black Cherry, Cedar, Raspberry, Red Fruit;Red;ABV 13.50%;California;Smooth & Mellow;2021
Louis Roederer 'Cristal' Champagne 2015;Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship wine. It was first made in 1876, when Tsar Alexander II asked the house to reserve their best cuvee for him every year. But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.;£300.00 per bottle;75CL;Chardonnay;null;Natural Cork;France;null;White;ABV 12.00%;null;null;2015
La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC, Treviso;In Treviso, Prosecco’s heartland, the locals have a motto to describe their home – ‘marca gioiosa et amorosa’, it’s a ‘joyful and loving’ place. It inspired the Moretti Polegato family when they needed a name for their wine business. They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect apéritif or party wine – and delicious with canapés.

The Macallan Sherry Oak 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky 70cl;The Macallan’s rich heritage dates back to 1824 – they were one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed. Since then they’ve built up a name as one of the world’s leading producers of single malt whisky. And their stellar reputation is down to their stringent standards for using the very best oak. This spends 12 years maturing in Oloroso sherry casks hand-picked by Macallan’s Master of Wood. The result? A complex sherried whisky with rich flavours of orange peel, dried fruit, vanilla, woodsmoke and spice.

Over its rich history, Bouvet Ladubay has been endorsed by Napoleon III and chosen as official supplier to the House of Lords. They specialise in bringing out the floral notes of Chenin Blanc, and it certainly shows in this lively, zesty fizz. Expect notes of honeysuckle, apple and lime, with a crisp, fresh finish.

The Ned 'Waihopai River' Sauvignon Blanc 2023, Marlborough;Our bestselling white wine. Winemaker Brent Marris’ father was the first person to plant Sauvignon vines in Marlborough. Brent has had just as big an impact on Kiwi Sauvignon. He’s got rafts of awards to show for it, and that certainly reflects here. It’s the most refreshing thing you could pour into your glass. Full of gooseberry and grapefruit flavours, it’s grassy, tropical and seriously aromatic. Fantastic with Thai fishcakes.

Moët & Chandon 'Brut Impérial' Champagne;Moët is the ultimate celebratory fizz. The house is credited with inventing the Champagne glass pyramid. The victorious ‘spray’ of Champagne familiar to sport podiums is also down to them. But not only does their famous label put you in a party mood – it’s also a fantastic wine.

Taittinger Brut Réserve Champagne;The first time Pierre Taittinger visited Champagne was as an injured officer during WWI. He promised himself that he would return and buy an estate for his family. In 1932 he did just that. The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flavours. Taittinger was Bond’s Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated. We suggest cheese gougères, fresh from the oven.;£45.99 per bottle;75CL;Chardonnay;null;Natural Cork;France;null;White;ABV 12.50%;null;Crisp & Fruity;NV

Laurent-Perrier 'La Cuvée' Brut Champagne;Laurent-Perrier began in 1812, but this Champagne house isn't one to stick to traditions. The winemaking team recently tore up the recipe for their non-vintage cuvée. The old wine was already one of the best-selling Champagnes in the world – but they knew they could create something even better. They weren’t wrong. La Cuvée was released in 2017.

Two Hands 'Angels' Share' Shiraz 2021/22, McLaren Vale;Two Hands successfully prove that not all Aussie Shiraz is equal.

They’ve more than succeeded – and they’re now regarded as Shiraz experts. ‘Angels' Share’ was one of their very first wines.

Villa Maria 'Private Bin' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough;It took a lot of guts in the early 1960s, when George Fistonich – now Sir George – told his dad he was quitting a career in carpentry to try his hand at making wine.
